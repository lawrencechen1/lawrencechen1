# Hello World! 

My name is Lawrence, and here are a few things I'm working on:
- Student at UC Berkeley, majoring in DS/Econ with conjunct interests in math/stats/cs/industrial engineering/business. Yep. 
- Running/Basketball/Reading
- Making the world a better place. Haha, hopefully?

Oh by the way:
Pronouns: He series

If somehow I don't find a way to delete this page, ignore the side comments to myself. It's been a long year.
